# Mining Dashboards

During my year and a half in the Operational Excellence Department, one of my responsibilities was to create tools that allowed the Operational Director and the Operational Excellence Team to monitor production compliance.

The main challenge was to summarize the entire operation in just a few clicks â€” transitioning from static tables to a more user-friendly, graphical, and dynamic interface. To achieve this, it was necessary to understand the companyâ€™s data sources and design a reliable, automated way of retrieving them. The work presented here required collaboration across multiple departments and a solid understanding of the companyâ€™s data flow.

The creation of these dashboards relied primarily on **DAX, Power Query (M), and SQL**, while their maintenance required some knowledge of **Power BI gateways**.

## Context and Challenges

Managers traditionally monitored daily production using **SIREP**, a local platform that tracks tonnage, flow, grades, and consumption ratios. SIREP presents this information in tabular form, comparing actuals against forecast and budget targets. Data is available daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly â€” but only one date can be selected at a time.

This limitation made it impossible, for example, to directly compare two quarters. Further analysis was usually delegated to subordinates, who either exported data from SIREP or relied on on-premise systems such as SCADA.

SIREP is the **official corporate data source**, so it is regarded as the reference for reporting. While IT ensured SIREPâ€™s availability and functionality, I was responsible for the accuracy of the data being reported to it.

## An Improved Approach

The dashboard was designed as a **dynamic, interactive reporting tool** that presents the same official data as SIREP but with additional features:

* Daily updates with *to-date* calculations.
* Moving average vs. actual vs. target graphs.
* Adjusted production calculations to meet targets.
* Performance projections based on trends.
* A top-down navigation approach, enabled by Power BI, that lets users click graphs or values to drill down into details.

### Data Sources

The dashboard queries SIREPâ€™s SQL database for both actuals and targets (budget and forecast). Special handling was required for weighted averages: tables were pivoted and additional columns created in Power Query.

### Deployment

To make the dashboard available across the organization, I created a Power BI Workspace and added all relevant users. I requested a dedicated server from IT to host the gateway, avoiding on-premise limitations. Automatic updates were scheduled twice a day at 11:30 and 12:00.

## Final Result

The dashboard allows users to navigate through data from the **Mine, Crushing, Processing Plant, and equipment availability**.

* The **main page** can be filtered by month or quarter. It summarizes performance across three columns:

  1. To-date compliance
  2. Trend indicators
  3. Adjustments required to meet targets

* For ounces, the dashboard shows the remaining ounces needed within the period.

* Trend indicators are represented by triangles or an equal sign:

  * â–² Green upward triangle â†’ last actual value > 5% higher than the previous one
  * â–¼ Red downward triangle â†’ last actual value > 5% lower
  * = Equal sign â†’ variation within Â±5%

This provides executives with a quick overview of performance. Users can click on any variable to open a detailed report page.

Each variableâ€™s report includes:

* A line chart with actuals, 7-day moving average, and target.
* A colored compliance ring with cumulative compliance.
* Current moving average value.
* Projected performance if the current trend continues.
* Final target for the period.
* Daily production adjustments required to reach the target.

## Comments

With this implementation, directors and managers can quickly see production performance, track progress toward targets, and identify adjustments needed to reach goals. The simplicity of the dashboard answers the most common executive questions without compromising data reliability, since it uses the **official corporate source**.

Although its granularity is limited compared to operational tools, this was intentional: the dashboardâ€™s scope is focused on executive needs. More detailed operational monitoring is handled with tools such as Pi System.
